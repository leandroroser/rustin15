# A 15' coffee with ChatGPT where we talked about Rust, from a Python perspective. Like Plato's dialogues, but with hashmaps. 

Disclaimer: This conversation has undergone minor style edits, so please take it as it is - a conversation
with ChatGPT that may contain inaccuracies. However, it holds good educational value
to get started with Rust in just one hour or so.

Note: If you are using Rust for the very first time, a quick option is testing the language flavor
in a REPL using the evcxr kernel and a Jupyter notebook:

1) Install Rust and cargo: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html
2) Install evcxr: https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr/blob/main/evcxr_jupyter/README.md
3) 'jupyter notebook' in your terminal, and enjoy.


### Starting from the end

Thanks, this information was really useful. Can you generate a summary
of this conversation?

```
Sure! Here's a summary of our conversation:
We started by discussing Rust and how it compares to Python. 
We went over some of Rust's basic syntax and control structures, including if/else 
statements, loops, and match expressions. We also discussed Rust's data structures,
including vectors, hash maps, and enums. We talked about Rust's support 
for functions and methods, including closures and the unwrap() method. 
We covered some advanced Rust topics,  including macros, ownership and borrowing,
and error handling. 
Finally, we ended with some additional thoughts on Rust and its advantages. 
I hope this summary is helpful! Let me know if there's anything else 
I can do for you.
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey

```
Hello! How can I assist you today?
```

I need a quick overview of the Rust language. As you know, I know
Python. I want to transfer my Python knowledge into Rust. I want to know
how to create for loops, while, and other control structures. Can you
show me that?

```
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!
In Rust, you can create a for loop to iterate over 
a range of values using the .. operator:
```

``` rust
for i in 0..5 {
    println!("Value of i: {}", i);
}
```

```
This will print the following output:
```

``` rust
Value of i: 0
Value of i: 1
Value of i: 2
Value of i: 3
Value of i: 4
```

```
In the example above, we used the .. operator to create a range from 0 to 4 
(inclusive on the lower bound, exclusive on the upper bound). 
The loop iterates over each value in the range, and the current 
value is assigned to the variable i.

You can also create a while loop in Rust:
```

``` rust
let mut i = 0;
while i < 5 {
    println!("Value of i: {}", i);
    i += 1;
}
```

```
This will print the same output as the for loop example.

In the while loop, we start with an initial value of i = 0, 
and then loop while i is less than 5. Inside the loop,
we print the value of i, and then increment it by 1 using the += operator.

I hope this helps you get started with control structures in Rust. 
Let me know if you have any other questions!
```

What is the command “loop” used for?

```
The loop command in Rust is used to create an infinite loop 
that continues until it is explicitly exited using the break keyword. 
Here's an example:
```

``` rust
let mut counter = 0;

loop {
    println!("Counter value: {}", counter);
    counter += 1;
    if counter >= 5 {
        break;
    }
}
```

```
In the example above, we start with an initial value of counter = 0. 
The loop statement creates an infinite loop that iterates indefinitely. 
Inside the loop, we print the current value of counter using the println! macro,
increment counter by 1, and then check if counter has reached a value of 5. 
If counter is greater than or equal to 5, we use the break keyword to exit the loop.

The output of this code will be:
```

``` rust
Counter value: 0
Counter value: 1
Counter value: 2
Counter value: 3
Counter value: 4
```

```
Note that you should use the loop statement with caution, 
as an infinite loop that doesn't exit can cause your program to hang or crash. 
However, in certain cases, such as when implementing event loops or waiting for user input,
it can be useful to create an infinite loop that only exits 
under specific conditions using break.
```

Is that a do ..while?

```
No, Rust does not have a do..while loop like some other programming languages
such as C and Java. Instead, you can achieve similar behavior using a combination
of a loop and break statement. Here's an example:
```

``` rust
let mut i = 0;
loop {
    println!("Value of i: {}", i);
    i += 1;
    if i == 5 {
        break;
    }
}
```

```
In this example, we start with an initial value of i = 0, and then enter a loop block. 
Inside the loop, we print the value of i, increment it by 1, and then check
if it has reached a value of 5. If i is equal to 5, we use the break statement
to exit the loop.

This achieves the same result as a do..while loop in other languages, 
where the loop body is executed at least once before checking the loop condition.
In Rust, however, we explicitly check the condition at the end of each iteration
using the if statement.

I hope that clears things up! Let me know if you have any more questions.
```


Any other control structure to take into account?

```
Yes, Rust provides several other control structures that you may find useful
in your programming. Here are a few examples:

if..else
The if..else statement allows you to execute different code blocks 
depending on a boolean condition:
```

``` rust
let x = 5;

if x < 0 {
    println!("x is negative");
} else if x > 0 {
    println!("x is positive");
} else {
    println!("x is zero");
}
```

```
In this example, we check whether the value of x is negative, positive, or zero, 
and print a corresponding message. The else if and else branches are optional.

match
The match statement allows you to match a value against a set of patterns and execute
corresponding code blocks:
```

``` rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    1 => println!("x is one"),
    2 => println!("x is two"),
    3 | 4 | 5 => println!("x is three, four, or five"),
    _ => println!("x is something else"),
}
```

```
In this example, we match the value of x against a set of patterns.
If x is equal to 1, we print a message saying so. If x is equal to 2,
we print a different message. If x is equal to 3, 4, or 5, we print a third message. 
Finally, if x does not match any of these patterns, we print a generic message using
the _ placeholder.

continue
The continue statement is used inside a loop to skip the current iteration and move
on to the next one:
```

``` rust
for i in 0..5 {
    if i == 2 {
        continue;
    }
    println!("Value of i: {}", i);
}
```

```
In this example, we use the continue statement inside a for loop to skip the iteration
where i is equal to 2. This results in the following output:
```

``` rust
Value of i: 0
Value of i: 1
Value of i: 3
Value of i: 4
```

```
I hope this gives you an idea of some of the other control structures available in Rust.
Let me know if you have any more questions!
```

These are all the control structures?

```
No, Rust provides several other control structures in addition to the ones 
I mentioned earlier. Here are a few more examples:

for..in
The for..in loop is used to iterate over a collection of items, 
such as an array or a vector:
```

``` rust
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for number in numbers {
    println!("Value of number: {}", number);
}
```

```
In this example, we create a vector of numbers, and then use a for..in loop to
iterate over the vector and print each number.

while..let
The while..let loop is similar to a while loop, but allows you to destructure
a value and bind its parts to variables:
```

``` rust
let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

while let Some(number) = numbers.pop() {
    println!("Value of number: {}", number);
}
```

```
In this example, we use a while..let loop to repeatedly pop a number from the end
of a vector until the vector is empty. The pop method returns an Option<T> value,
which we destructure using the while..let syntax. If the value is Some(number), 
we bind the value of number to a variable and print it. If the value is None, 
the loop terminates.

if let
The if let statement is similar to the while..let loop, but allows you to conditionally 
execute code if a value matches a pattern:
```

``` rust
let some_value = Some(5);

if let Some(number) = some_value {
    println!("Value of number: {}", number);
}
```

```
In this example, we use an if let statement to check whether some_value
is equal to Some(number), and print the value of number if it is. 
If some_value is equal to None, the code block is not executed.

I hope this gives you a more comprehensive overview of the control structures
available in Rust. Let me know if you have any more questions!
```

Amazing. Now show me data structures. I need a quick summary of data
sturctures in rust.

```
Sure! Rust provides several data structures that you can use to store and manipulate data.
Here are some of the most common ones:

Vectors
Vectors, or dynamic arrays, are one of the most commonly used data structures in Rust. 
They allow you to store a collection of items of the same type and dynamically resize
the collection as needed:
```

``` rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
v.push(4);
```

```
In this example, we create a vector containing the values 1, 2, and 3. 
We then use the push method to add the value 4 to the end of the vector.

Arrays
Arrays are fixed-size collections of items of the same type. Unlike vectors, 
their size is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed at runtime:
```

``` rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

```
In this example, we create an array containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The size of the array is determined by the number of values in the initializer.

Slices
Slices are references to a contiguous sequence of elements in a data structure. 
They are commonly used to pass subsets of arrays or vectors to functions:
```

``` rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..4];
```

```
In this example, we create a slice containing the values 2, 3, and 4 from the array a.
The .. notation specifies a range of indices, and the & operator is used to create
a reference to the slice.

Strings
Strings in Rust are UTF-8 encoded and are represented as a collection of bytes. 
Rust provides several string types, including String, which is a growable string,
and &str, which is an immutable reference to a string slice:
```

``` rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = "world";
let s3 = format!("{} {}", s1, s2);
```

```
In this example, we create a String containing the value "hello", 
a string slice containing the value "world", and a new String created
by concatenating s1 and s2 using the format! macro.

Hash Maps
Hash maps are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps
to a corresponding value. Rust's HashMap type is implemented using a hash table, 
which provides fast lookups and insertions:
```

``` rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert("apple", 3);
map.insert("banana", 2);
map.insert("orange", 5);
```

```
In this example, we create a new HashMap, and then insert several key-value pairs
into it using the insert method.

These are just a few examples of the data structures available in Rust. 
Rust also provides many other data structures, including tuples, structs, 
enums, and more. Let me know if you have any more questions!
```

Now I want to have a quick overview of methods. Methods for strings,
numbers, vectors, hash maps

```
Sure! In Rust, methods are functions that are associated with a particular data type.
Here are some examples of methods that are commonly used with strings, numbers, 
vectors, and hash maps:
```

``` rust
// Methods for Strings

let s = String::from("hello world");

// Returns the length of the string
let len = s.len();

// Returns a new string with all characters converted to uppercase
let upper = s.to_uppercase();

// Returns a new string with all characters converted to lowercase
let lower = s.to_lowercase();

// Returns true if the string contains the given substring
let contains_hello = s.contains("hello");

// Splits the string into substrings at the given separator
let words: Vec<&str> = s.split(" ").collect();


// Methods for Numbers

let x = 42;

// Returns the absolute value of the number
let abs = x.abs();

// Returns the maximum of two numbers
let max = x.max(20);

// Returns the minimum of two numbers
let min = x.min(20);

// Returns the value raised to the power of n
let pow = x.pow(2);

// Returns the square root of the value
let sqrt = x.sqrt();


// Methods for Vectors

let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

// Returns the length of the vector
let len = v.len();

// Returns a new vector with all elements multiplied by the given factor
let scaled: Vec<i32> = v.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();

// Returns a new vector containing only the elements that satisfy the given predicate
let filtered: Vec<i32> = v.iter().filter(|x| *x > 1).cloned().collect();

// Appends the given element to the end of the vector
v.push(4);

// Removes the last element from the vector and returns it
let popped = v.pop();


// Methods for Hash Maps

use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert("apple", 3);
map.insert("banana", 2);
map.insert("orange", 5);

// Returns the value associated with the given key, or None if the key is not in the map
let value = map.get("apple");

// Inserts the given key-value pair into the map
map.insert("pear", 4);

// Removes the given key-value pair from the map and returns the value
let removed = map.remove("banana");

// Returns true if the map contains the given key
let contains_apple = map.contains_key("apple");
```

```
These are just a few examples of the many methods available 
for Rust's standard library types. Let me know if you have any more questions!
```

Any equivalent to lambda functions in rust?

```
Yes, Rust has closures, which are similar to lambda functions 
in other programming languages. Closures are anonymous functions 
that can capture variables from their surrounding environment. 
Here's an example of a closure that adds two numbers together:
```

``` rust
let add = |a, b| a + b;
let result = add(2, 3);
println!("{}", result); // prints "5"
```

```
In this example, the |a, b| a + b syntax defines a closure 
that takes two parameters (a and b) and returns their sum. 
The closure is then assigned to the variable add, which can
be used like a regular function.

Closures can also capture variables from their surrounding environment, like so:
```

``` rust
let x = 10;
let add_x = |a| a + x;
let result = add_x(2);
println!("{}", result); // prints "12"
```

```
In this example, the closure |a| a + x captures the variable x
from its surrounding environment and adds it to the parameter a.
The closure is then assigned to the variable add_x, which can be
used like a regular function.

Closures are a powerful tool in Rust, and they are often used 
in combination with iterators to perform complex operations on collections.
```

Any other thing I should know if I am coming from python? what about
advanced features such as decorators?


```{ eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
Yes, there are some other things you might want to know about
    Rust if you're coming from Python. Here are a few:

    Rust is a statically typed language, which means that types are checked at compile-time
    rather than run-time. This can make Rust code more efficient and reliable, but it can 
    also be more verbose than Python.

    Rust has a very strong focus on memory safety and control, which means that it has some   
    features that might be unfamiliar to Python developers. For example, Rust uses a system of 
    ownership and borrowing to ensure that memory is managed correctly and efficiently.

    Rust has a powerful macro system that can be used to generate code at compile-time. 
    Macros can be used to implement advanced features like decorators, but they can also
    be used for many other purposes, such as code generation and metaprogramming.

    Regarding decorators, Rust doesn't have a direct equivalent to Python decorators,
    but you can achieve similar functionality using macros. Rust macros can be used
    to generate code that wraps existing functions or types, similar to how decorators 
    work in Python. Here's an example of a simple macro that adds a debug function to a struct:
```  

``` rust
macro_rules! debug {
    ($name:expr) => {
        impl $name {
            fn debug(&self) {
                println!("{:?}", self);
            }
        }
    };
}

struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

debug!(Person);

fn main() {
    let p = Person {
        name: "Alice".to_string(),
        age: 25,
    };
    p.debug(); // prints "Person { name: \"Alice\", age: 25 }"
}
```

```
In this example, the debug macro generates an implementation
of the debug function for the given struct. The macro is 
then called with the Person struct as its argument, which
generates the necessary code to add the debug function to the
Person struct. The debug function simply prints the contents of
the struct using the {:?} format specifier.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
```

What about classes?

```
Rust has a concept called "structs", which are similar to classes
in Python. Structs are used to define custom data types, 
and they can have methods associated with them.

Here's an example of a simple struct in Rust:
```

``` rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> u32 {
        2 * (self.width + self.height)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
    println!("Perimeter: {}", rect.perimeter());
}
```

```
In this example, we define a struct called Rectangle with two fields:
width and height. We then define two methods associated with the struct:
area, which calculates the area of the rectangle, and perimeter, 
which calculates the perimeter of the rectangle. Note that the self parameter
refers to the instance of the struct on which the method is called.

To create an instance of the struct, we simply use the syntax 
let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };. We can then 
call the methods on the instance using the dot notation, like rect.area().

One difference between Rust structs and Python classes is that Rust
structs are not object-oriented in the same way that Python classes are.
Rust structs do not have inheritance or polymorphism, for example. 
However, Rust's implementation of structs can be very efficient and flexible,
and they are often used in place of classes in performance-critical code.
```

Nice. I’m still trying to understand the use of vec! after declaring an
object vec of type Vec. Why the “!” 

```
The vec! macro is used to create a
new Vec object with initial values. It’s a convenient way to create a
new vector and initialize its elements at the same time.
The ! after vec is part of the syntax of the macro. In Rust, 
macros are invoked using an exclamation mark (!) after the macro name,
like vec!(1, 2, 3) or println!("Hello, world!").

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use vec! to create a new vector:
```

``` rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

```
In this example, we use vec! to create a new Vec object containing
the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The type of v is inferred to be Vec<i32>.

Note that the vec! macro can be used with any type 
that implements the Default trait, which includes most of the built-in types in Rust
(e.g. bool, char, u8, i32, etc.). If you need to initialize a vector
with values of a custom type, you can implement the Default trait
for that type, or use a different method of initializing the vector
(such as calling push or insert after creating an empty vector).
```

Which are macros I should remember?

```
There are many useful macros in Rust, but here are 
a few that you might find particularly useful:

println!: This macro is used to print formatted text
to the console. It works similarly to Python's print function,
but uses a syntax similar to C's printf.

assert!: This macro is used to test for a condition 
at runtime, and will panic if the condition is false.
It's a simple way to write unit tests for your code.

vec!: This macro is used to create a new Vec object 
with initial values, as I explained in my previous message.

format!: This macro is used to create a formatted string,
similar to println!, but without printing it to the console.
It can be useful for generating dynamic strings that you need to pass to other functions.

match!: This macro is used to perform pattern matching on a value. 
It's similar to a switch statement in other languages,
but with more powerful matching capabilities.

cfg!: This macro is used to conditionally compile code
based on the target platform or other build parameters.
It can be useful for writing cross-platform code 
that works on multiple architectures.

These are just a few examples of useful Rust macros. 
There are many others that you may find useful depending on your needs.
```

So for example println! is another function under the hood?

```
Yes, that's correct! In Rust, println! is actually a macro
that expands into a function call at compile time.

When you write something like:
```

```rust
println!("Hello, world!");
```

```
the Rust compiler expands it into something like:
```

``` rust
std::io::stdout().write_all(b"Hello, world!\n").unwrap();
```

```
This is done at compile time, so there's no performance penalty
at runtime for using macros instead of functions.

The println! macro also supports formatting, which allows
you to interpolate values into the output string using placeholders
like %d for integers or %s for strings. For example:
```

``` rust
let name = "Alice";
let age = 42;
println!("{} is {} years old.", name, age);
```

```
This would print Alice is 42 years old. to the console.

So, while println! looks and behaves like a function, 
it's actually a macro that expands into a call to a function at compile time.
```

What is that unwrap method for?

```
In Rust, unwrap() is a method that's used to extract 
the result from a Result or Option object, while also handling any errors that might occur.

For example, let's say you have a Result<i32, io::Error> object,
which represents either an i32 value or an error of type io::Error.
You can use unwrap() to extract the i32 value and handle any
errors that might occur, like this:
```

``` rust
let result: Result<i32, io::Error> = get_some_number();
let value = result.unwrap(); // Extract the i32 value or panic if there's an error
```

```
If the Result object contains an i32 value, then unwrap()
will return that value. But if the Result object contains an error,
then unwrap() will panic and terminate the program with an error message.

The unwrap() method is useful when you're sure that the Result
or Option object contains a valid value, and you want 
to extract it quickly and easily. However, it's important
to use unwrap() carefully, because if the object does contain
an error, then your program will terminate with an error message.
In some cases, it might be better to handle errors explicitly using match
or other error handling techniques, rather than relying on unwrap().
```

Any other thought regarding things I should know?

```
Yes, there are some other things you might want to know about Rust if you're coming from Python. Here are a few:

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that types are checked at compile-time rather than run-time.
This can make Rust code more efficient and reliable, but it can also be more verbose than Python.
Rust has a very strong focus on memory safety and control, which means that it has some features
that might be unfamiliar to Python developers. For example, Rust uses a system of ownership and borrowing 
to ensure that memory is managed correctly and efficiently.
Rust has a powerful macro system that can be used to generate code at compile-time. Macros can be used
to implement advanced features like decorators, but they can also be used for many other purposes, 
such as code generation and metaprogramming.
Regarding decorators, Rust doesn't have a direct equivalent to Python decorators, but there are some 
similar concepts. For example, Rust has attributes, which are similar to decorators in that they allow
you to annotate items in your code with additional metadata. Attributes can be used to control how functions,
structs, enums, and other items are compiled, or to provide additional information to the Rust compiler.

Rust also has procedural macros, which are similar to Python decorators in that they allow you to modify
the behavior of functions and other items at compile-time. Procedural macros can be used to implement custom
derive macros, which are similar to Python decorators that use the @staticmethod or @classmethod syntax. 
Custom derive macros can be used to generate code for structs, enums, and other items based on their structure and properties.

Here are some examples of Rust's ownership system:
```

``` rust
// Example 1: Transfer of Ownership

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
    println!("{}", s2);
}
``` 

``` 
In this example, s1 is created and assigned the value "hello". Then, s2 is assigned the value of s1. 
However, the ownership of s1 is transferred to s2. Therefore, s1 is no longer valid after this assignment.
``` 

``` rust
// Example 2: Borrowing

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
``` 

``` 
In this example, a reference to s1 is passed to the calculate_length function using the & operator. 
The function calculate_length borrows the reference to s1 and returns its length without taking ownership. 
Therefore, s1 remains valid after the function call.
``` 

Which are best practices in Rust?

``` 
- Follow the Rust programming style guide: Rust has an official style guide that outlines 
how code should be formatted, structured, and documented. Following this guide can help make
your code more readable and easier to maintain.

- Use Rust's ownership model: Rust's ownership model helps ensure memory safety and prevent common
bugs like null pointer dereferences and use-after-free errors. Make sure to use Rust's ownership features 
like borrowing and lifetimes to manage memory correctly.

- Write tests: Rust has a built-in testing framework that makes it easy to write tests for your code.
Writing tests can help catch bugs early and ensure that your code is working correctly.

- Use Rust's standard library: Rust's standard library contains many useful data types and functions 
that can save you time and prevent bugs. For example, use the Option and Result types instead of
using null pointers or throwing exceptions.

- Avoid unwrap() and panic!() in production code: While unwrap() and panic!() can be useful for prototyping
and testing, they should be avoided in production code. Instead, use match statements or if let expressions
to handle errors and unexpected conditions.

- Use Rust's type system to prevent bugs: Rust's type system can help prevent bugs by catching type mismatches
and other errors at compile time. For example, use Rust's enum type to represent a finite set of possible values.

- Use Cargo to manage dependencies: Rust's package manager, Cargo, makes it easy to manage dependencies and
build your project. Use cargo build to build your project, cargo test to run tests, and cargo doc to generate documentation.

- Document your code: Rust's doc comments make it easy to generate documentation for your code. Make sure to 
document your functions, types, and modules so that other developers can understand how to use your code.

- Use match instead of if for pattern matching: Rust's match statement is more powerful than if statements 
because it allows you to pattern match on multiple values at once. This can help make your code more concise and expressive.

- Use const and static for constants: Rust's const and static keywords can be used to define compile-time constants.
This can help improve performance and prevent bugs caused by changing values accidentally.

- These are just a few best practices in Rust. By following these guidelines and continuing to learn more about 
Rust's features and ecosystem, you can write high-quality Rust code that is both performant and safe.

What about static typing if i come from python and don't use with frequency type hints? Can you show me examples?

``` 
Sure! In Rust, all variables have to be declared with a type, and the compiler checks that the types are
used correctly throughout the program. This is called "static typing".

Here's an example of how static typing works in Rust:
``` 

``` rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5; // x is declared with type i32
    let y = "hello"; // y is declared with type &str

    let z = x + y; // this will cause a compile-time error, because x and y have different types
}
``` 

``` 
In this example, x is declared with type i32, which is a 32-bit signed integer, while y is declared 
with type &str, which is a reference to a string. The + operator is used to concatenate strings in Rust,
but it can't be used to add an integer and a string.

In Python, you can use type hints to specify the types of variables and function parameters, but they are optional 
and not enforced by the interpreter. Here's an example of how type hints work in Python:
``` 

``` rust
def add_numbers(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

result = add_numbers(5, "hello") # this will not cause a compile-time error, but it will cause a runtime error
``` 

``` 
In this example, the add_numbers function takes two integer parameters, x and y, and returns an integer result.
The type hints indicate that x and y should be integers, but if we call the function with a string instead of an
integer for y, it will cause a runtime error. Unlike Rust, Python does not enforce the types specified in the
type hints, so it's up to the programmer to make sure that the types are used correctly.

In summary, static typing in Rust helps catch errors at compile time, while type hints in Python are optional
and do not enforce type correctness at runtime.
``` 

But you are not declaring types in the first code chunk

``` 
In Rust, you don't always have to explicitly declare types in your code because the compiler can often infer
them based on context. However, Rust is still a statically-typed language, which means that every value has
a type that is determined at compile time and cannot change at runtime.

Let me give you an example. Consider the following Rust function:
``` 

``` rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
``` 

``` 
This function takes two i32 values as arguments and returns their sum as an i32. Here, we have explicitly 
declared the types of the function parameters and return value using the : i32 notation. However, we could
also have written the same function without explicit type annotations:
``` 

``` rust
fn add(x, y) {
    x + y
}
``` 

``` 
In this version of the function, the Rust compiler would infer that x and y are both of type i32 based
on the fact that we are performing addition with them, and would infer that the return value is also 
an i32 based on the fact that we are returning the result of the addition.

It's worth noting that while Rust's type inference can save you some typing, it's generally considered 
good practice to provide type annotations in your code whenever it makes the code clearer and easier 
to understand. Additionally, Rust's type system provides a number of benefits, such as preventing common
programming errors at compile time and improving the performance of your code, so it's worth investing 
some time in learning how to use it effectively.
``` 

``` 
What about being more verbose with types?
``` 

``` 
In Rust, you can choose to be more verbose with types if you prefer. For example, instead of writing:
``` 

``` rust
let x = 5;
``` 

``` 
You could write:
``` 

``` rust
let x: i32 = 5;
``` 

``` 
This explicitly declares that x is an i32 (a 32-bit signed integer). Similarly, you could write:
``` 

``` rust
let name: String = String::from("Alice");
``` 

``` 
This declares that name is a String type, and sets its initial value to a new String instance
containing the text "Alice".

Using explicit type annotations can make your code more clear and easier to read, especially 
in situations where the type might not be immediately obvious from the context. However, Rust's 
type inference is generally very good, so you may find that you don't need to be as verbose with 
types as you might be in other languages.
